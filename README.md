# Code Style Guidelines

## Guidelines for this project

- Short rules with a sample.
- Only the correct example.
- Short reasoning if needed and possible.
- Link to discussion or source if needed.
- Order contents so that simpler stuff is followed by more complex rules
and the examples only use the preceding contents.

## Table of contents

Some of the docs are written in Latvian, some are in English. Might make it all
bilingual at some time.

- [Applicable to everything](general.md)
- English
	- [Markdown](markdown.md)
	- [CSS](css.md)
- Latviski
	- [HTML](html.md)

## Documentation

Use Markdown for documentation. It is supported by many tools, including
editors and GitHub.
